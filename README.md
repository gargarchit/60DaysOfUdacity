## Day 1/60 [June 27, 2019]

:heavy_check_mark: Completed my first project implemented using **PyTorch** after correcting all errors
:andrew: **Classification_of_MNIST_Digits_using_Differential_Privacy_and_performing_PATE_analysis_on_that_model related to Lesson 6 Differential Privacy and Deep Learning**:python:

Link ::link:   https://github.com/gargarchit/PATE_Analysis   with Accuracy 92.363%


:heavy_check_mark:Implemented Project based on official Paper using PyTorch **SEMI-SUPERVISED KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER FOR DEEP LEARNING FROM PRIVATE TRAINING DATA**

:heavy_check_mark:Take Part in AMA session :akshit-sir:

Already Encouraged @Manisha & @Labiba to take part and they started as well :bettertogether:

## Day 2/60 [June 28, 2019] #60daysofudacity
:heavy_check_mark:Started working on my second Project: **Federated Learning on MNIST using PyTorch:torch_heart_big: + PySyft :andrew:**

i.e Final Project of Lesson 7: Federated Learning :panda_dance:

Link:link:: https://github.com/gargarchit/Federated-Learning-on-MNIST

:heavy_check_mark:Completed coursework till Lesson 8 Part 3 i.e **Intro to Additive Secret Sharing [Securing Federated Learning]**

:heavy_check_mark:Make a Repo Link: https://github.com/gargarchit/60DaysOfUdacity to manage my Daily Updates on #60daysofudacity

:heavy_check_mark:Would Like to Encourage around 400 scholars added by me in this Channel Today :bettertogether:

i.e Final Project of Lesson 7: Federated Learning :panda_dance:

Link:link:: https://github.com/gargarchit/Federated-Learning-on-MNIST

Spent nearly 3 hours debugging and therefore *achieved 98.9000% Accuracy*

:heavy_check_mark:Completed coursework till Lesson 8 Part 4 i.e *Fixing Additive Secret Sharing [Securing Federated Learning]*:andrew:

:heavy_check_mark: Take part in quiz organized by @Rishi S Rao (Reading Group) *Got 90% Score*:bananadance:

:heavy_check_mark: Revise Lesson 7 Part 1 to Part 8 {Helps me in Debugging}:done:

:dart: Updated: https://github.com/gargarchit/60DaysOfUdacity

:bettertogether:Would Like to Encourage @Calincan Mircea Ioan, @Yemi:yemi:
