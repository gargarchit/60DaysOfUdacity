:heavy_check_mark: Worked on *Hackathon Blossom (Flower Classification)* with @Aniket Thomas and @Vebby

       [Training of model done and now working on evaluating where training took more than 3 hours to work on this]
       
:heavy_check_mark: Checkout my notes and some blogs for doing *Keystone Project*

:heavy_check_mark: Working on *Pooling Layers* Part 30 lesson 5 *Intro to deep learning with Pytorch* Today I did Part 25-30

:heavy_check_mark: learning how to Deploying deep learning model
